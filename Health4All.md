[21/09, 5:31 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Ok... So what makes anything expensive? 

We had the commodity vs niche discussion a few days back. 

In anything to do with science and tech it's the parents that become the clog in the system to universal access. 

At the same time, *parents are not evil* - we need to amortize our investment and risks taken. 

What we really need are *people owned research*

Now how is that possible? There costs, and skills, and a myriad other things. 

True... But save a few, how many billionaires are researchers and inventors themselves? 

The workers are from among the people! 

As for infrastructure, I will share my views in the next message
[21/09, 5:34 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Oh... Spell checker is evil... 

Nothing wrong with parents... 

Patents!!!! 

Now I know why the lawyer didn't respond... Who would reply to whether he's a *parent attorney*ðŸ¥´
[21/09, 5:44 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Enterprises are not evil... Cannot be

Their *ownership pattern* and *control systems* are! At times... 

We need capital... But that capital has to be... Of/for/by the people

And no... Government owned machinery is not going to be it's alter ego... 

The philosophy behind stock exchanges is such... But bringing about a Red Herring where we propose majority *people ownership* is not feasible under the rules... And rallying so many people together is not an easy job

Again, when and if at all, such corporates are formed they will face the eponymous  need for a *benevolent dictator*

Any popular person can be one... 

But this person should be driven towards that goal - of inclusive access. 

History shows us such roads have been dug up with Machiavellian pot holes.
[21/09, 5:47 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Then, whenever that *then* has a critical mass, research in true interest of *inclusive access* can be seeded

Thereafter, the system has to sustain till a point of *plateau*. Any failures before that will result in a slide back
[21/09, 5:50 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Here are the numbers... 

1.5 billion people... If 10 inr face value shares are restricted to maximum 100 units per natural citizen... With 30% subscription we get a capital of 500 billion inr

That's 7 billion USD! 

Now tell us how can billion USD be used to bring about *inclusive accessible healthcare*
[21/09, 5:52 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Checking the math

10 x 100 units = 1000 subscription limit

1.5 bil x 1000 = 1500 bil

30% of that is 500 bil

At today's exchange rate ... 6.26 billion USD
[21/09, 6:17 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Now various legislation may play spoilsport... 

I not suggesting breaking any law! 

But the dynamics don't work out. 

We will not have such a capital realized... Subscriptions will not happen... 

An alternate pathway is needed... 

Let say what would we use such a huge fund for... 

Capex part... 

1. Setup research / teaching institutions that cover all aspects needed to maintain health from fetal to petal position (my version of womb to tomb!) 

2. Logistics infrastructure - for geo locating and transferring both matter and information

3. Manufacturing units

4. Cognitive tools (IT, AI, IoT, HPC etc) 

Opex parts... 

1. Worker sustenance (doctor, researcher, pharma, para, and every other trade needed... All of them need to run their kitchens) 

2. Materials / Matter resources

3. Energy sources

4. Communication and transportation
[21/09, 6:23 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Now... How can this 4x4 (capex opex) model be achieved *without* mass capital

1. Teaching and research institutions exist... *PIs need to drive inclusive healthcare projects* - and choose non predatory open access publications channels

2. Logistics needs some capital (can't help that! Though I have been working on a plot called *The Oil Revolutionaries* - another form of Tor in the post singularity world) 

Information exchange, though not free, is still quite accessible

3. Manufacturing units... Need to move towards *table top* manufacturing and be run by *micro entrepreneurs*

4. Cognitive tools need to remain in open domain (the technological Singularity must not be owned by Big Tech)
[21/09, 6:29 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Now for the opex... 

1. Won't doctors / other HCW consulting on this network not need sustenance? Let's debate how HIT can help with that

2. Material resources have reached a point of *extra terrestrial* sources... We need people owned space exploration... Meanwhile, not HIT but other cognitive tools can help us leverage what we have among us... We can also have symbiotic relationships with *restrictive / imperialistic capital* manufacturers to begin with

3. Energy and knowledge are the currencies of the future times... We need answers for these

4. Communication efforts (aka news and media / advertising) need to be crowdsourced
[21/09, 6:30 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Next what... 

Clinical trials... 

Well by definition it's a people's healthcare network... Will it be as expensive to carry out clinical trials there? 

How can HIT help? Let's debate
[21/09, 6:31 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Answered with my PoV above
