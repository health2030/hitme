[19/11, 12:06 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Thank you for sensitizing us to this Sir. 

While the broader question remains of harmonizing biological data within the PDP umbrella, I see no mention of electro physiological data. 

With BCI becoming more mainstream, the traits of our personality is quite vividly represented in our neural ensemble. 

I will share two links to top global contenders, and AyeAI has it as it's core research focus. 

Getting clarity on this can lead to clarity on the genetic data question.

It may suffice to say that both genetic sequence and BCI data are biological personally identifiable signals, and again both have common trends (in the case of BCI artifacts like sleep spindles and alpha / delta correlation etc while in genetics ORFs, NRFs etc along with individual identified genes) 

From a information theory perspective, the number of artifacts needed to cause a multi occupancy pigeon hole for 8 billion people will be (assuming binary signal, or other signals binary encoded) 

log(8 bil)/log(2) = <33

And even if we double the population, 34 signals suffice

Therefore, taking a simple biochemistry report with sufficient entropy can identify an individual uniquely (especially when triangulated with available demographic features in anonymized databases) 

Furthermore, even with classical algorithms it is possible to brute force an O(n) algorithm to this - optimizable to O(log n)
[19/11, 12:13 am] Abhishek Choudhary: It's not time consuming to process O(n) population data  anymore. 

Need to check what are the published figures for qubits - but even at 100x with the worst coherence we should be good to deanonymize at around 3-4k qubits

IBM recently publicized 400+ qubits system

Time frame - maybe 2 years at most to get to 4k qubits, or with rapid improvement in quantum communication (not just key exchange) matter of months.
[19/11, 12:17 am] Abhishek Choudhary: Anyway these are inputs for deliberation

I will share the BCI companies link.
